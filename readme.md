# Tree Folder Printer

This code contains an attempt of making a script in Rust that works as follows:

If I have a folder,
calling
`tree-folder-printer ./path` will print something like this

```
path/
  ├── test_file1.txt
  └── test_folder_2/
    └── test_file2.c
```

The root folder has an image "what-i-want-to-implement.png", which is a sort of flowchart I made to describe what I wanted to implement, as I don't know Rust Syntax well, and I wanted to first express my idea with recursion.
